The Agera RS is the ultimate in road and track versatility. It
offers extreme performance and is fully road-legal,
complying with safety standards, emissions and
homologation requirements worldwide. It uses advanced
technology developed during our Koenigsegg One:1
program while maintaining all the functionality of previous
S and R models.

Practicalities inherited from the Agera R and S programs include a usable luggage compartment and a detachable hardtop that can be stowed internally for top-down motoring at any time.

Agera RS enhancements include: advanced lightweight sound insulation, a front splitter optimized for the track, front winglets, side skirts, advanced dynamic underbody flap system and a dynamically active rear spoiler for added down force (now up to 450 kg at 250 km/h). The RS also features improved side air outlets behind the front wheels, increased power and a raised rpm limit.

Even with this added functionality and equipment, the curb weight is  lower than the Agera S and R models, thanks to the use of advanced composites and layup techniques developed during the One:1 program.

The Agera RS included options such as Koenigsegg's active self-levelling chassis package, 3G connected Pre-Active chassis setups, alternative aero packages, active sound cancellation and much more.

equipped with a 5.0-liter twin-turbo V8, the Agera RS produces 1176 horsepower and 940 lb-ft of torque in standard form. The 1MW upgrade boosts these numbers to 1360 hp and an even 1,000 lb-ft. When equipped with the upgrade, the Agera RS reaches 60 mph in under 2.9-seconds and blasts to 124 mph in under 7-seconds.
